Hexagon sticker created with the [hexSticker R library](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/hexSticker). 

The illustration inside the hexagon corresponds to the mosaic salamander statue that resides at the gates of [Park Güell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_G%C3%BCell), an important symbol of Barcelona. ‘El Drac’ is known by multiple names, such as ‘the dragon’ and ‘the Park Güell lizard’. Acting as a guard for Park Güell, it was created from brick and is coated with Gaudí’s signature Trecandís technique.
